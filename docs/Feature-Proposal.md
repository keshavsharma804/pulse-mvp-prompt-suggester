    # Contextual Prompt Composer (Feature Proposal)

## Overview
The Contextual Prompt Composer (CPC) is an intelligent micro-feature designed to increase user productivity inside Pulse by automatically generating context-aware prompts and actions. Whenever a user views or pastes a conversation, CPC analyzes the text and proactively suggests summaries, action items, and reply drafts without requiring the user to manually engineer prompts.

This feature provides immediate value for users who work with long threads, client updates, team discussions, or support messages.

## Problem Statement
Users interacting with AI tools often struggle with:
- writing effective prompts
- knowing what actions to take from a conversation
- switching between summary, action items, and replies
- manually rewriting or extracting information

Even experienced users waste time designing prompts instead of focusing on decisions and next steps.

Pulse can improve proactivity and user experience by offering one-click prompt suggestions based on workspace context.

## Target Users
- Product managers reviewing internal threads  
- Customer success and support teams responding to clients  
- Analysts working with messy or unstructured information  
- Anyone needing quick summaries or follow-up actions

## Use Case Example

### Input
A user pastes or selects a conversation like:

- Pricing sheet updates  
- Missing metrics  
- A client request  
- Team member updates  
- Request for a reply  

### CPC Output
CPC instantly shows:

1. **Summary (bullets)**  
   Condensed key points.

2. **Action Items**  
   Automatically extracted tasks, owners, and next steps.

3. **Draft Reply**  
   A polite, context-aware message the user can send or refine.

This reduces manual work and makes AI assistance proactive.
